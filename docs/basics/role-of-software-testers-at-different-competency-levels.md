# The Role of Software Testers at Different Competency Levels

In the software development process, testing plays a crucial role. Testers have specific tasks to perform, but what distinguishes a good tester from an average one, and a very good tester from a good one, is not only skills but also the degree of responsibility and proactivity. In this article, we will analyze different competency levels in software testing.

## Basic Level - Tester

At the basic level, we have the regular tester. Their main task is to provide information about the product quality and the risk associated with its release to the market. This is the fundamental role of testers, which we cannot do without, and for which we primarily pay. Testers at this level focus on learning and improving their skills to effectively convey relevant information.

## Intermediate Level - Good Tester

A good tester, at the second level, goes a step further. They are accountable for what they have tested, but not in the sense that they claim the product is perfect because they tested it. The responsibility of a good tester lies in the fact that if they were given a specific system component to test and said it would take a certain time, then after the allotted time, they can assert that they tested everything to the best of their abilities. If they are a good tester, we can assume that there are no critical errors there. However, this requires some experience and professionalism.

## Advanced Level - Very Good Tester

A very good tester, at the third level, is competent enough that their work leads to an improvement in product quality. Such achievement can come in various forms. It may result from good bug descriptions, proactive work with developers, or suggesting improvements. A very good tester not only effectively identifies bugs but also proactively proposes ways to fix them.

In conclusion, success in a tester's work depends on skillful planning, prioritizing, and above all, thinking. As the Pareto principle says, 80% of users only use 20% of the system's functionalities. So let's focus on those 20% and success is guaranteed. However, remember that regardless of the level we are on, there is always room for growth and improvement. Testers, regardless of their level of advancement, should strive to continuously improve their skills and shape a proactive approach to their role. Only then can they effectively contribute to improving the quality of the product and the success of the entire project. Remember that the key to success is not only the ability to perform tests but also thinking and communication - these are what really make a difference.
