# Rules of Effective Testing - Tips for Beginner Testers

## Introduction

In today's article, I would like to share with you two key principles that will help you become more effective testers. Communication plays a crucial role here, and asking questions at the beginning of your work is extremely important. Let's take a closer look at these rules.

## Principle 1: Communication is Key

When you receive a task to test a product, it is important that you ask questions and communicate with the person commissioning the tests. Do not be afraid to ask for details, such as the time you have to test the product. This basic question should be asked at the beginning of every testing job.

Even a simple application may have many elements to test. Before you start testing, think about what exactly you need to test, what you should focus on, which environment, browser, in what language. Ask questions about what is most important and how to report bugs. It is also important to know how much time you have to perform the tests.

## Principle 2: Ask Questions

When someone asks you to test something, always try to ask for all the details. Even if in larger companies everything will be prepared for you, in smaller companies and start-ups, you will need to ask questions yourself. This will allow you to better understand the task and often helps the person commissioning the work to notice something they would not have seen on their own.

Remember that your value as testers lies not only in finding bugs but also in contributing to the project's success. Therefore, always ask as many questions as possible. Find out what needs to be done, by when, what the order is, what is most important, what to focus on, which version to test on, which device, in what configuration, where to report bugs, and so on.

# Summary

Effective testing requires good communication and asking questions. Remember to ask questions about details and requirements at the beginning of every testing job. This will help you better understand the task and contribute to the project's success. Do not forget these rules and always try to ask as many questions as possible.
