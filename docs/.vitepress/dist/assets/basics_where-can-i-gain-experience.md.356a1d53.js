Here Are Some Ways to Gain Experience <a class="header-anchor" href="#are-you-a-beginner-tester-here-are-some-ways-to-gain-experience" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Are You a Beginner Tester? Here Are Some Ways to Gain Experience&quot;">​</a></h1><p>Have you ever wondered where you can get practical experience as a beginner tester? The good news is that there are many places where you can practice and develop your skills in testing. Below we present three main methods.</p><h2 id="_1-beta-testing-various-apps-and-games" tabindex="-1">1. Beta Testing Various Apps and Games <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-beta-testing-various-apps-and-games" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1. Beta Testing Various Apps and Games&quot;">​</a></h2><p>One of the easiest ways to gain experience in testing is to participate in beta tests of various applications, especially computer games. Many companies offer the opportunity to sign up for beta tests of their products. You then get early access to the game or app and have the chance to report bugs before it is officially released to the market.</p><h2 id="_2-open-source-projects" tabindex="-1">2. Open Source Projects <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-open-source-projects" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2. Open Source Projects&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Another way to gain experience is by participating in open source projects. These are free projects that people work on collaboratively. They often look for not only developers but also testers, and even those who create documentation for these products. This is a great opportunity to understand how the testing process works in practice.</p><h2 id="_3-crowd-testing" tabindex="-1">3. Crowd Testing <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-crowd-testing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3. Crowd Testing&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The last, but not least, method is crowd testing. This is a process where companies use the resources of a &quot;crowd&quot; of testers scattered around the world to test their products. All you have to do is register on a crowd testing platform, such as uTest or Test.io.</p><p>At uTest, for example, you must first go through an &quot;academy&quot; that teaches you step by step how to detect bugs, report them, create reports, go through test cases, and also acquaints you with tools for collecting screenshots, documenting bugs, and capturing transmissions. After completing this course, you can start working on various assignments from different companies, testing various products, from apps to websites.</p><p>Although crowd testing is not recommended as a primary source of income (payments are often for each unique bug you report), it is an excellent way to gain valuable experience that can be added to your resume. In addition, on these platforms, you can learn from other testers by observing what bugs they found and how they conducted their tests. In this way, you can acquire a &quot;tester&#39;s eye&quot; and learn what to look out for during testing.</p><p>Some people specialize in specific areas of testing, such as security testing or performance testing, and can make a living through crowd testing. Such bugs are often better paid, and the competition is lower. If you are a specialist in a specific area, this could be a good option for you.</p><p>In conclusion, it&#39;s worth remembering that practice is key to becoming a good tester. Whether you choose beta testing, open source projects, or crowd testing, remember that the most important thing is to test regularly and learn from your experiences. This way, you can continuously develop your skills and become an effective tester.</p><h2 id="frequently-asked-questions" tabindex="-1">Frequently Asked Questions: <a class="header-anchor" href="#frequently-asked-questions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Frequently Asked Questions:&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li>What are the benefits of participating in beta tests of apps and games?</li><li>What skills can be acquired through participation in open source projects?</li><li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of crowd testing?</li><li>Is crowd testing profitable?</li><li>What are the best ways to learn testing?</li></ol><hr>',15),n=[r];function i(c,p,u,h,l,d){return a(),t("div",null,n)}const f=e(s,[["render",i]]);export{m as __pageData,f as default};
