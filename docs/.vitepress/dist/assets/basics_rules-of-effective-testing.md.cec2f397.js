Communication plays a crucial role here, and asking questions at the beginning of your work is extremely important.

Do not be afraid to ask for details, such as the time you have to test the product. This basic question should be asked at the beginning of every testing job.</p><p>Even a simple application may have many elements to test. Before you start testing, think about what exactly you need to test, what you should focus on, which environment, browser, in what language. Ask questions about what is most important and how to report bugs. It is also important to know how much time you have to perform the tests.</p><h2 id="principle-2-ask-questions" tabindex="-1">Principle 2: Ask Questions <a class="header-anchor" href="#principle-2-ask-questions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Principle 2: Ask Questions&quot;">​</a></h2><p>When someone asks you to test something, always try to ask for all the details. Even if in larger companies everything will be prepared for you, in smaller companies and start-ups, you will need to ask questions yourself. This will allow you to better understand the task and often helps the person commissioning the work to notice something they would not have seen on their own.</p><p>Remember that your value as testers lies not only in finding bugs but also in contributing to the project&#39;s success. Therefore, always ask as many questions as possible. Find out what needs to be done, by when, what the order is, what is most important, what to focus on, which version to test on, which device, in what configuration, where to report bugs, and so on.</p><h1 id="summary" tabindex="-1">Summary <a class="header-anchor" href="#summary" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Summary&quot;">​</a></h1><p>Effective testing requires good communication and asking questions.
